    """
    This class defines interface statistics.  It will provide methods to
    retrieve the stats.  The stats are returned as a dictionary with the
    following structure:

    stats= {<counterFamily>:{<counter>:value}}

    stats are gathered and summed up in time intervals or granularities.
    For each granularity there are a set of time periods identified by
    the <period> field.  The current stats are stored in period 0.  These
    stats are zeroed at the beginning of the time interval and are updated
    at a smaller time interval depending on the granularity.  Historical
    statistics have periods that are greater than 0.  The number of historical
    stats to keep is determined by the monitoring policy and may be specific
    to a particular counter family.

    The counter families are as follows: 'egrTotal', 'egrBytes', 'egrPkts',
    'egrDropPkts', 'ingrBytes', 'ingrPkts', 'ingrTotal', 'ingrDropPkts',
    'ingrUnkBytes','ingrUnkPkts', 'ingrStorm'.

    The granularities are: '5min', '15min', '1h', '1d', '1w', '1mo',
    '1qtr', and '1year'.

    For each counter family/granularity/period there are several counter
    values retained.  The best way to see a list of these counters is to
    print the keys of the dictionary.
